Metrics:
    - Time for each sample to forward and backward
    - Time for each element in sample to computed (for convo, for fully connected)
    - Tiem for each epoch

Create synthetic data generator

Create basic CUDA code for convolution, measure CPU baseline

- Baseline of original code:
    - Get the time for each batch, or each sample, and each element, to forward and backward
        - Vary by data size, stride?, kernel size
